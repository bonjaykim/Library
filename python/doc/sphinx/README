# reStructuredText (RST)
- reStructuredText is a plain text markup language that's part of the Docutils project in the Python ecosystem.
  It's commonly used for technical documentation, especially for Python libraries and applications.
- RST files are used with Sphinx, a ducumentation generator that can output various formats including HTML, PDF, and ePub.
- reStructuredText is chosen for its simplicity and readability. 
  It's designed to be easy to write and edit without specialized tools.

# Starting a Documentation Project with reStructuredText
1. Install Sphinx
- Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- Install Sphinx using pip: `pip install sphinx`

2. Set up Documentation Project
- Run `sphinx-quickstart` in your project directory.
  This tool sets up a basic documentation structure.
- Answer the prompts to configure your project.

3. Write Documentation
- Create '.rst' files in the 'source' directory.
- Write your documentation using reStructuredText syntax.
  For example, use 'code-block:: python' to include a Python code block.

4. Configure Sphinx
- Edit 'conf.py' in the 'source' directory to configure Sphinx settings, like the theme or extensions.
- If you have docstrings in your Python code, you can use the autodoc extension to include these in your documentation.

5. Build the Documentation
- Run `make html` to build HTML documentation. (windows: `make.bat html`)
- The output will be in the 'build directory.

6. Review and Publish
- Review the generated HTML files.
- For publishing, you can host the 'build' directory contents on a web server or use platforms like ReadTheDocs.


# Apply most popular theme
1. Install the Theme
- First, you need to install the theme. It can be installed via 'pip', Python's package manager.
  Open your command line and run:
  `pip install sphinx_rtd_theme`

2. Configure Sphinx to Use the Theme
- After installing the theme, you need to configure your Sphinx project to use it.
  This is done by editing the 'conf.py' file in your Sphinx project directory.
  in 'conf.py', find the line that sets the 'html_theme' variable and change it to 'sphinx_rtd_theme'.
  It will look something like this.
  `html_theme = 'sphinx_rtd_theme'`

3. Optional Customizations
- The Read the docs theme supports various customizations, such as changing the color scheme or layout.
  These customizations can be done by setting theme options in your 'conf.py' file.
  doc link: 'https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/'

4. Rebuild Your Documentation
- After making these changes, navigate back to your command line and rebuild your documentation to see the changes.
  If you are using the `make` command, it would be
  `make html`

5. Check the Results
- Once the build is complete, open the generated HTML files in your 'build' directory to see your documentation with the new theme.
